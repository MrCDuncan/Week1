This program will generate a random number between 0 and 101 then have the user guess the number prompting them with higher or lower hints until the correct number is guessed.
 
This is a single source file. 
To compile, save file to working folder on a system with JAVA SE SDK. JAVA SE SDK bin folder must be part of system environmental path.
From command line, change to working folder with source file.
Run "javac AgeGuess.java" to create class file
Execute with the following command "java ageguess"

Enter a number between 0 and 101
System will response with a hint to guess higher or lower.
Continue to input a different number until the system responds with a successful result.
Program will only exit upon a successful result.
